CI/CD plays a crucial role in streamlining the development and deployment process of a Flask application, ensuring
faster delivery and higher quality. Here's how:

**CI (Continuous Integration):**

* **Automated Builds:** CI automates the build process, which involves taking your Flask application code and
dependencies and transforming them into a runnable package (e.g., a Docker image). This eliminates manual build errors
and ensures consistent builds.
* **Automated Tests:** CI automatically runs your tests (unit tests, integration tests, etc.) after each code change.
This provides immediate feedback on code quality and helps catch bugs early in the development cycle.
* **Early Detection of Issues:** CI identifies integration problems between different components of your Flask
application early on, preventing major issues during later stages.
* **Improved Code Quality:** Regular builds and testing encourage developers to write cleaner and more maintainable
code, as they know their changes will be rigorously evaluated.

**CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment):**

* **Automated Deployment:** CD automates the deployment process, pushing your built and tested Flask application to your
desired environment (development, testing, production). This reduces manual errors and allows for faster deployments.
* **Faster Delivery Cycles:** CD enables you to release new features and bug fixes to users more frequently, increasing
agility and responsiveness to customer needs.
* **Reduced Risk:** By deploying changes incrementally and automatically, CD mitigates the risk associated with manual
deployments and reduces the potential for downtime or errors.
* **Improved Collaboration:** CI/CD promotes better collaboration between development, testing, and operations teams, as
everyone has visibility into the build and deployment process.

**In summary, CI/CD helps you:**

* **Speed up development:** Faster builds and deployments mean more time for innovation and less time spent on manual
tasks.
* **Improve code quality:** Automated testing catches bugs early and promotes best practices.
* **Reduce errors:** Automating the entire process reduces the potential for human error.
* **Increase agility:** Rapid deployments allow you to respond quickly to market demands and user feedback.
